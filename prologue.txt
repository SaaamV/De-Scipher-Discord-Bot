_In an alternate reality..._
**Elon Musk** has finally managed to colonise Mars, and has quickly become one of the most influential people in global politics. However, his arch nemesis, **Jeff Bezos**, is also not far behind. Soon after, he also built human colonies in the Venusian atmosphere. 
Back on earth, tension is building up, and soon a war breaks out. Earthlings are forced to choose sides between the **Muskonian and the Bezonian empire.**
These empires are not enemies (this is what their media says all the time), but they don't get along very well either. The Bezonians have set up a **sophisticated system of spies**, just for keeping an eye on their neighbours.

Fast forward to many years, the Solar System is becoming unstable and inhospitable with each passing day. Both the civilisations must find another planet. This is the perfect opportunity for the Bezonians to outshine their rivals, something they've been looking for since long. But the Muskonians, always one step ahead, have already found another celestial body to colonise.
