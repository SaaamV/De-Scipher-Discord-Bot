The Muskonian scouts, after having found a habitable planet, were reported travelling back to their base. They, being aware of the spies, took a proxy route in order to cover their trails. You and your teammate(s) hijack the spaceship of the Muskonian scouts(thanks to your sophisticated spy network) in the hope of finding some clues for your mission, to your surprise you find the spaceship completely empty, set on autopilot. "Why is no one here ?", you ask yourself. But does it matter? You brush off that topic and start checking their computers for discovering some important clues. What riddles lay ahead no one knows.
