"They did it! They have survived".
You and your teammate(s) on hearing this start celebrating, finally your mission is coming to an end! But here's the catch, this round was just for your survival, just for your survival!
It was all a plan from the beginning, the elder ones, a very powerful civilization could easily tackle a solar storm, but they wanted to be sure if your planet was worth conquering! That is why the ship was empty on realising the potent threat , the Muskonian spies fled and the paranoia drove them mad and they all committed suicide! Luckily their spaceship survived, and you got the access to it.
Now, many things make sense to you, the sabotaged data storage, the apparently weird style of the crew log, the empty ship of the Muskonians. Apparently , Arnold was driven mad after his hopes of meeting Mr. Dyson shattered.
Truth be told, you ended up destroying everything you wanted to save! Your family, your friends, your planet! The test was just whether you could do the bidding for the elder ones, their spokesperson, their slave for eternity, their beasts of burden. Now you have to live with this eternal regret, as the time on their planets pass on very slowly! A slow torture, the perfect reward for you!
