I was attached by just an umbilical cord of cables to our spacecraft coming from **45.965°N 63.305°E** as it orbited the Earth at 30,000 kph. Yet a felt as if I were almost motionless, Boating above a vast blue sphere draped with a colourful map, Lifting my head I could see the curvature of the Earth horizon. "So the world is round", I said softly to myself, as if the words came from somewhere deep in my soul. For a few moments, I felt alone in this pristine new environment, taking in the beauty of the panorama below me with an artist's eye.

With a few minutes left in the **sunrise**, I struggled to be victorious.
