Finally, you get the key, and are now heading towards the upper chamber of the ship, you look around yourself and wonder at the sophisticated technology and workmanship of the Muskonian engineers, and can't help but praise them, despite them being your rivals.
The ship looked pretty small from the outside but, their engineers had managed to accommodate a very large space inside and at the same time somehow gave it a compact look.(Another marvel of their engineering).
**"Wouldn't things have been better if there were no rivalry between us"**, you wonder.
Reaching the chamber, you enter the password and the door opens. You look around and see that most of the storage space was sabotaged, as if some mania had consumed the Muskonian scouts or they wanted to hide something.  You copy all the data that survived, and **to your surprise the door to the chamber was well protected but the system folders weren't!, you found that very surprising.**
You plug in the data card to your computer and a new folder appears. There you find that the storage mostly contained crew logs but, most of the files there were damaged. Maybe investigating it would reveal something to you.
