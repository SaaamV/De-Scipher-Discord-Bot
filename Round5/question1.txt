_Before everything comes to an end_
_It is worth remembering how it all began_
_Talented were the ones chosen_
_The hopes of your people._
_Like a distant lamp flickering in the desert_
_Yet brave you all were, when the stakes were high even_
_Alas! the ones who wander into darkness realise it often too later/_
_That being said doesn't mean it was a waste_ 
_Ah! You served your purpose well_
_And don't make haste because_  
_Slow is the noose around your necks_
_Could you even manage the conflict amongst yourself, talking about conquering the galaxy (Laughs!)_ 
_A tiny droplet you are in an ocean unseen_
_Pursuit of wonder is it? or a vial of misery_
_Take a look around you , you are witnessing the god itself_
_Unless we want there would be no end_
_Regardless, your end is certain (Laughs!)_ 
_End is near, end is near_
_Doomsday you may call it, if it suits your feeble minds_
